# Flutter starter

This is a starter for any Flutter project.


## Set up

- Check dependencies (Some basic dependencies have been chosen for you. Each dependency's use is specified, feel free to comment/remove those you won't use.)
- Rename the project's name (in `pubspec.yaml`) and mass replace all occurrences of ":flutter_starter" with ":<your project name>" and all occurrences of "com.jpec.flutter_starter" with your android id and ios id.
- Change `BASE_REMOTE_URL` in `rest.dart`



## A few commands to get started

### Icon

Run `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main` to generate your launch icon

### JSON Serialization

Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` after a change in the `models` directory.
